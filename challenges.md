# Challenges



Testing Serbian variant...

Are you a leader in an enterprise software development organization, interested in producing quality software? Have you experienced the challenges in managing software projects - satisfying customers' needs to produce software faster, but yet at the same time, facing quality issues?

Have you seen systems which rapidly deteriorated in quality, whereby the architecture is a "big ball of mud", and low code quality - and the decreased productivity of the whole team? Is there an increasing pile of bugs, and are changes taking longer and longer to implement, breaking existing functionality? Do you face challenges in incorporating new team members, increasing the technical level of your team, and incorporating code standards and quality control?

## Biggest pains

What are the biggest pains faced by software development companies? Working in the software development industry, there are several pains and challenges which are faced during the development of software projects and products.

**Project-based development companies** may face the following challenges:

* Software projects are often delivered late and over-budget
* Software projects which fail to meet client expectations
* Many bugs during project releases, leading to client dissatisfaction
* Cost of implementing changes in perceived as too expensive by the client
* Higher total cost of ownership \(TCO\) due to low quality and implementation of changes
* Test automation is "too expensive", can't fit into the client budget
* Decreased profits due to increased unbillable time spent on bug fixes \(in case that the software development is paying for the bugs\)
* Decreased customer satisfaction due to bug fixes \(in case that the customer is paying for the bug fixes\)
* Challenges in forming teams and moving developers from one project to another, high startup-time
* Challenges when incorporating juniors and decreases in quality due to lack of training

**Product-based development companies** may face the following challenges:

* Code bases with high maintenance costs due to poor architecture and quality issues
* Evolving the product takes too much time, as changes take longer and longer to implement when adding additional functionalities
* Testing the product takes too long, with large amount of regression bugs
* Increased total cost of ownership \(TCO\) leading to loss in profit
* When the product code base becomes very large, it is difficult to push forward refactoring \(or rewrite efforts\)
* Product may be difficult to scale and have performance issues as more and more users use the product
* Product may have security issues, which is especially an issue with products used by many clients
* Inconsistencies in different product modules, lack of re-use across the product
* Difficulties when new developers join the team, being able to work effectively on the large code base
* Decreased productivity as the code base increases

## Root causes

What are the causes of issues faced by software development companies? The root causes may be split into two categories:

* **People issues**: poor leadership, employee engagement challenges, issues with company culture and with teams
* **Process issues**: unclear or undefined processes and roles, complex processes and bureaucracy in large companies, poor organization, poor communication channels, challenges in requirements management processes
* **Technical issues**: low quality architecture \(monolithic systems, high coupling between components\), low code quality, lack of re-use

There are plenty of articles written on the topics of people issues and process issues - including the increased focus on leadership, motivation, culture as well as using Agile processes.
